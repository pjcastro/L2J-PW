<html><body>Sergeant Allenos:<br>
There is a battle raging, so I'm afraid I can't allow you to enter right now. The Mounted Troop controls every entrance, and they would kill you as soon as you came through.<br>
We'll know soon enough whether our clan will continue to occupy this place or whether Tiat will take the Throne again...<br>
